      "1. Accelerating the transition\n",
      "The roadmap details our new level of commitment to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon and \n",
      "climate-resilient economy. By 2025, the EIB will increase its support for climate action and environmental \n",
      "sustainability to exceed 50% of its overall lending.\n",
      "This means that we will continue to support areas that have already made considerable progress in the \n",
      "transition (such as low-carbon electricity, electric vehicles and battery storage) and tackle other areas \n",
      "that are lagging behind. For investments in natural capital Œ carbon sinks, biodiversity and ecosystem \n",
      "preservation, for example Œ the transition has barely begun.\n",
      "To accelerate the transition, the Climate Bank Roadmap stresses four key messages about the value that \n",
      "the EIB Group can provide. A major one is substantially increasing adaptation efforts, supporting the \n",
      "new EU Adaptation Strategy. A second message is to focus on investment in innovative green \n",
      "technologies, alongside new business models. A third is to help drive down the long-term cost of capital \n",
      "in capital-intensive green infrastructure. Finally, the EIB can help drive aggregation, scalability and \n",
      "replicability to boost investment.\n",
      "In close cooperation with EU Member States, the EIB Group will use this support to help deliver national \n",
      "energy and climate plans, national adaptation strategies, as well as recovery and resilience plans. \n",
      " \n",
      "This approach extends beyond the European Union, where the EIB works with individual countries \n",
      " \n",
      "to support ambitious nationally determined contributions (\n",
      "NDC Spotlight | UNFCCC\n",
      "). This includes \n",
      " \n",
      "projects in some of the most vulnerable regions on our planet.\n",
      "2. Ensuring a just transition for all\n",
      "Supporting cohesion was one of the founding principles of the EIB when it was established in 1958, and \n",
      "it continues to be a core priority. The green and resilient transition should leave no person or region \n",
      "behind. A just transition is of particular concern for countries that currently rely on carbon-intensive \n",
      "sectors or where local economies may become less viable due to climate change. In both cases, strategic \n",
      "action is needed to develop new skills in the workforce along with new, green and resilient economies \n",

      "Just\n",
      " Transition Mechanism\n",

      "The EIB Group will play a central role in the mechanism, supporting, to varying degrees, each of its three \n",

      "Our Advisory Services team will complement and support all three pillars, providing guidance on \n",

      "the EIB, we are supporting both objectives and stepping up our efforts for two key themes: (i) gender \n",

      "strengthen climate, environmental and social outcomes and increase the overall positive impact of \n",
      "projects. At the same time, reducing fragility can also contribute to the success of a just transition. Our \n",

      "3. Supporting Paris-aligned operations\n",
      "The European Union has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by at least 55% by 2030 and to \n",
      "achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In line with these objectives, the EIB Group \n",
      "committed to aligning all our financing activities with the goals and principles of the Paris Agreement \n",
      "by the end of 2020. The roadmap lays out our framework for putting this commitment into practice. It \n",
      "covers the low-carbon and climate-resilient dimensions.\n",
      "To align with low-carbon pathways, we adopted sector-specific criteria for carbon-intensive sectors of \n",
      "the economy, such as energy (already addressed through the 2019 EIB energy lending policy), aviation, \n",
      "road infrastructure, road vehicles, energy-intensive industries, as well as agriculture and forestry. These \n",
      "criteria are set out in a series of simple tables, facilitating engagement with potential clients. Sector-\n",
      "based criteria are also applied across the wide range of EIB Group products. The alignment framework \n",
      "is adapted for intermediated SME and mid-cap finance. For these products, the framework focuses on \n",
      "three sectors: energy, mobile assets for transport services and energy-intensive industries, ensuring that \n",
      "certain high-emitting industries do not receive support from standard products.\n",
      "The alignment framework helps define the Group™s priorities for a given sector. For instance, we will \n",
      "focus on improving existing airport capacity, including safety, security and decarbonisation, but will no \n",
      "longer support airport capacity expansion and conventionally fuelled aircraft. In industry, we will look \n",
      "at innovation in low-carbon technologies Œ and therefore withdraw from any new capacity based on \n",
      "traditional high-carbon processes. In the farming sector, we will concentrate on meat and dairy \n",
      "industries with improved greenhouse gas emissions profiles thanks to the sustainable animal-rearing \n",
      "methods they adopt.\n",
      "As part of the roadmap, we revised the shadow cost of carbon, a key technical parameter used to \n",
      "estimate the full value for society when a tonne of carbon is saved. The Bank has been using the shadow \n",
      "cost of carbon for projects that go through an economic assessment since the 1990s. To align with the \n",
      "Paris Agreement, we reviewed the latest modelling evidence and agreed to increase these values. \n",
      " \n",
      "As shown in the graph below, the shadow cost of emitting one tonne of carbon equivalent rises to \n",
      " \n",
      "•250 by 2030 and to •800 by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "An example of how the revised cost of carbon will affect investments is road infrastructure. In line with \n",
      "the decarbonisation efforts underway in this sector, the EIB will adapt its economic test for large \n",
      "projects. Traffic demand forecasts will be adapted in line with long-term modelling studies, with due \n",
      "attention paid to the penetration rates of electric vehicles. The projects™ net emissions will be valued at \n",
      "the EIB™s new shadow cost of carbon. Adopting the new unit values will strengthen the business case for \n",
      "projects that save carbon while penalising those that increase emissions.\n",
      "The second dimension of alignment concerns climate resilience. To manage physical climate risk and \n",
      "promote projects that support resilient development, the EIB has introduced a new Climate Risk \n",
      "Assessment (CRA) system for direct lending. The system will be the cornerstone of our alignment \n",
      "framework. The CRA system helps the EIB and its clients understand how climate change may affect \n",
      "their projects and identify adaptation measures.\n",
      "As described later on in the report, we have also developed a climate risk tool which provides an \n",
