            "India’s economy showed robust growth over the past year. Headline inflation has, on average, moderated although it remains volatile. Employment has surpassed the pre pandemic level and, while the informal sector continues to dominate, formalization has progressed. The financial sector has been resilient—strongest in several years—and largely unaffected by global financial stress in early 2023. The current account deficit in FY2022/23 widened as the post-pandemic recovery of domestic demand and transitory external shocks outweighed the impact of robust services exports and proactive diversification of critical oil imports. While the budget deficit has eased, public debt remains elevated and fiscal buffers need to be rebuilt. Globally, India’s 2023 G20 presidency has demonstrated the country’s important role in advancing multilateral policy priorities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Growth is expected to remain strong, supported by macroeconomic and financial stability. Real GDP is projected to grow at 6.3 percent in FY2023/24 and FY2024/25. Headline inflation is expected to gradually decline to the target although it remains volatile due to food price shocks. The current account deficit is expected to improve to 1.8 percent of GDP in FY2023/24 as a result of resilient services exports and, to a lesser extent, lower oil import costs. Going forward, the country’s foundational digital public infrastructure and a strong government infrastructure program will continue to sustain growth. India has potential for even higher growth, with greater contributions from labor and human capital, if comprehensive reforms are implemented.\n",
            "\n",
            "Risks to the outlook are balanced. A sharp global growth slowdown in the near term would affect India through trade and financial channels. Further global supply disruptions could cause recurrent commodity price volatility, increasing fiscal pressures for India. Domestically, weather shocks could reignite inflationary pressures and prompt further food export restrictions. On the upside, stronger than expected consumer demand and private investment would raise growth. Further liberalization of foreign investment could increase India’s role in global value chains, boosting exports. Implementation of labor market reforms could raise employment and growth.\n",

While acknowledging that India’s debt composition helps mitigate debt sustainability risks, Directors recommended ambitious medium-term consolidation efforts given elevated public debt levels and contingent liability risks. In that context, improving revenue mobilization and spending efficiency would allow for continued improvements in digital and physical infrastructure and targeted social support.

They agreed that the current neutral monetary policy stance, anchored on a data dependent approach, is appropriate and should gradually bring inflation back to target. Directors agreed that exchange rate flexibility should remain the first line of defense in absorbing external shocks, with foreign exchange interventions limited to addressing disorderly market conditions. Regarding staff’s recent reclassification of India’s de facto exchange rate regime for the period December 2022 to October 2023, many Directors noted the divergence of authorities’ views with that of staff and encouraged continued staff engagement on this issue, with a few Directors encouraging staff and the authorities to resolve these differences. A few Directors explicitly supported the authorities’ view that exchange rate stability reflects improvements in India’s external position and that foreign exchange interventions have been used to avoid excessive volatility not warranted by fundamentals.\n",

            "Directors welcomed that the financial sector remains stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets, and adequate capital and liquidity buffers. While acknowledging declining systemic financial risks, Directors broadly called for continued supervision and the use of prudential tools to preserve financial stability and manage emerging vulnerabilities, including rapid growth in unsecured personal loans. They advised further strengthening of regulatory and supervisory standards and encouraged public banks to continue building capital buffers.\n",

            "Directors noted that continuing with comprehensive structural reforms can help further leverage India’s favorable demographics and encouraged the authorities to promote job-rich, inclusive, and greener growth. They emphasized that improving labor market functioning, increasing female labor force participation, and making progress on health, education, land, and agricultural reforms remain critical to sustaining strong and inclusive growth.

            "\n",
            "Fiscal policy to ensure medium-term sustainability while boosting inclusive growth. Elevated public debt calls for ambitious medium-term consolidation, while continuing to prioritize capital spending. This should be complemented with a sound medium-term fiscal framework to promote transparency and accountability and align policies with India’s development goals. Sovereign debt risks are moderate and are mitigated by the composition of debt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Monetary policy to achieve price stability. The RBI’s monetary policy tightening was effective in addressing inflation. Going forward, a data-dependent approach should continue given high uncertainty surrounding the outlook. Clearly communicated monetary policy can help guide market expectations. Greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb external shocks, with intervention limited to addressing disorderly market conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Financial sector policy to continue to promote resilience. Systemic financial risks have declined but continued vigilant supervision is warranted to manage emerging vulnerabilities, including rapid growth in unsecured personal loans. Policies to facilitate the exit of non-viable firms, enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework, and encourage public banks to continue building capital buffers remain priorities. Ongoing efforts to further strengthen bank governance, deepen capital markets, and expand MSMEs’ access to credit should help support medium-term growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "Structural policies to invigorate inclusive and green growth. To reap the benefits of demographic tailwinds, structural policy should focus on promoting high quality job-rich growth, underpinned by comprehensive reform in areas of education, health, land, agriculture, and labor markets, including measures to boost female labor force participation. Continuing investment in infrastructure, strengthening governance, and enhancing a sound business environment are critical. Expeditiously removing recently introduced trade restrictions would support growth and improve global food supply. Finally, concerted efforts on climate policies are instrumental to achieve India’s ambitious climate goals.\n",

After surging during FY2022/23, headline inflation has, on average, moderated although it remains volatile. Employment has surpassed the pre-pandemic level and the informal sector continues to dominate while formalization has progressed. The financial sector has been resilient, largely unaffected by global financial stress in early 2023. While the budget deficit has eased, public debt remains elevated and fiscal buffers need to be rebuilt. Globally, India’s 2023 G20 presidency has demonstrated the country’s important role in advancing multilateral policy priorities. On the political front, general elections are expected in April 2024. Macroeconomic policies have been partly in line with past IMF staff advice (Annex I).\n",

Growth has been supported by robust consumption stemming from pent-up demand of households and strong investment, with historically high levels of public capital expenditure.

However, a 202-percent year- on-year increase in tomato prices in July 2023, together with increases in other food prices, pushed headline inflation up to 7.4 percent in that month, highlighting the vulnerability of the disinflation process to exogenous shocks (Box 1). The shock began moderating since August and in September, headline inflation declined sharply to 5 percent, within the RBI’s tolerance band. Only 36 percent of the CPI basket experienced increases greater than 6 percent in September. Core inflation declined to 4.5 percent. Wholesale prices have been declining since April 2023.\n",

According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the labor force participation rate (LFPR) increased to 54.6 percent in AY2022/23, primarily driven by own-account, casual, and unpaid family workers, while the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent.2 By sector, employment in agriculture and construction has increased the most since AY2017/18, with services picking up more recently. Real wages also recovered from the pandemic-driven decline, which was larger for self-employed workers. Nominal wages for regular workers have broadly kept up with inflation since AY2017/18, whereas wages for casual workers have enjoyed gains in real terms. Box 1. Inflation Dynamics in India\n",

            "India’s recent inflation dynamics have not followed the same pattern as in other countries.1 Inflation in India increased in late 2019, driven by higher prices of vegetables after adverse weather shocks. It came up above the RBI’s tolerance band (4±2 percent) in December and remained above 6 percent for most of 2020. Elsewhere, inflation generally did not increase until mid-2021, when economies began to emerge from pandemic lockdowns and supply chains came under pressure. India however did not experience a large increase in the inflation rate when most economies suffered from elevated commodity prices in 2022, reflecting extensive government interventions (e.g., restrictions on wheat, sugar, and rice exports, removal of tax on import of lentils, reversal of earlier increases in excise duties on petrol and diesel). Notably, India’s pick-up in inflation was also different, even when limiting the sample to emerging economies and, among those, to emerging economies practicing inflation targeting.\n",

            "The increase in core inflation in India was also particular.2 Core inflation in India picked up significantly earlier than elsewhere, reaching close to 6 percent as early as October 2020. Core inflation remained elevated, oscillating around 6 percent, until a sharp decline began in March 2023. The increase in core inflation was first led by transportation, and then by clothing. It likely reflected exchange rate depreciation, increase in fuel excise duties in 2020, and pass-through of higher food prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "The RBI appropriately targets headline CPI inflation, while remaining vigilant over core inflation, which is also important.3 While conventional wisdom suggests that central banks should concentrate on core inflation and disregard transitory changes in fuel and food inflation, that approach does not seem appropriate for India. First, core inflation components represent just 47 percent of the CPI basket, much lower than in other emerging market peers practicing inflation targeting. Second, food price increases could spill over into higher core inflation, especially if they are persistent. Granger causality tests provide evidence of bidirectional Granger causality between food and core inflation rates in India, perhaps mediated by household inflation expectations. Third, it is easier to communicate monetary policy based on headline inflation, rather than core inflation. At the same time, given that food inflation remains very volatile in India, achieving the RBI’s headline inflation target sustainably requires having core inflation hovering around 4 percent and allowing the tolerance bands to handle food price shocks. As a consequence, this could require the RBI to tighten monetary policy in the case of sizable and persistent exogenous weather shocks to avoid de-anchoring of inflation expectations and transmission to core inflation. Government administrative interventions to mitigate food price pressures can be appropriate on a temporary basis to address major emergencies. However, they negatively impact global food markets and should be removed expeditiously, also to allow market forces to provide adequate incentives to economic agents.\n",

In response to the one-off shock of the INR2000 banknotes withdrawal, the RBI also implemented in August an incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) of 10 percent on the increase in banks’ net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19, 2023, and July 28, 2023 and then unwound the ICRR in a phased manner in September-October.

Under a deep FX market and with inflation expectations remaining well-anchored, Scenario 1 shows that exchange rate flexibility can help absorb the shock and there is no additional benefit of FXI to mitigate the output-inflation tradeoffs. Scenario 2 assumes a severe risk-off shock due to global financial market turbulence, inducing a domestic risk premium. Staff’s analysis finds that under this scenario, FXI can help limit excessive rupee depreciation and absorb the pressure from monetary policy tightening to contain inflation. This in turn helps soften an adverse impact on domestic demand, thereby reducing the decline in output. Nonetheless, the scope for using FXI relies on its effectiveness in stabilizing the exchange rate. In some cases, having a meaningful impact on the exchange rate may require the use of large amounts of reserves, making FXI costly, and infeasible if reserves are limited.\n",

Over the past two years, the Rupee-U.S. Dollar had moved significantly, depreciating by about 15 percent between December 2019 and November 2022 (Figure 5, panel 1). Over the past year, improved domestic macroeconomic stability, supported by tightening monetary policy, has helped attract capital inflows. Based on FXI data that the RBI publishes on a monthly basis, the RBI has been using FXI to cushion the impact of external shocks, smooth market volatility, preclude emergence of disorderly market conditions (DMC), and opportunistically replenish its FX reserves. However, during December 2022-October 2023, the Rupee-U.S. Dollar exchange rate moved within a very narrow range, suggesting that FXI likely exceeded levels necessary to address disorderly market conditions. The observed stability of the exchange rate prompted staff to reclassify India’s de facto exchange rate regime from “floating” to “stabilized arrangement” for that period, while the de jure classification remained “floating” (see Informational Annex).17 FX reserves are assessed at just above 100 percent of the IMF composite reserve adequacy metric for a stabilized exchange rate regime.

The RBI strongly disagreed with staff’s assessment that FXI likely exceeded levels necessary to address disorderly market conditions and has contributed to the Rupee-USD moving within a narrow range since December 2022. The RBI strongly believes that such a view is incorrect as, in their view, it uses data selectively. In their view, staff’s assessment is short-term and restricted to the last 6-8 months without any rationale for the same, and if a longer-term view of 2-5 years is taken, staff’s assessment would fail. In the authorities’ view, therefore, staff’s reclassification of the de facto exchange rate regime to “stabilized arrangement” is unjustified. They noted that the RBI’s FXI comply with the best principles of transparency since FXI data dissemination in the public domain complies with SDDS standards prescribed by the IMF, and that the rupee continues to be a market determined currency, with no explicit/implicit target/band. The authorities also stated that they remain committed to their stance of minimizing volatility for financial stability considerations but without any view on the level for the rupee. Moreover, in their view, the exchange rate’s stability in 2023 reflects the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals and improvements in India’s external position, particularly significant moderation in the current account deficit (CAD) and revival of capital flows on the back of a comfortable foreign exchange reserves buffer. Overall, they noted that India’s macroeconomic stability also imparted stability to the exchange rate. Regarding the IPF analysis, the authorities noted that India has well-anchored inflation expectations, limited FX mismatches, deep FX markets, and rising international investor confidence as reflected in the surge in portfolio flows, external commercial borrowings and rise in non-resident deposits during 2023-24 so far.\n",

Bank profitability has increased, with return on assets reaching 1.2 percent—the best in a decade—albeit remaining relatively low on a cross-country basis. Net interest margins (and income) have strengthened through the course of the monetary policy cycle, bolstering earnings, although further gains may be challenging as bank funding costs rise and deposit growth has lagged credit growth. Gross nonperforming asset ratios18 have fallen to multiyear lows at 3.9 percent and 4.3 percent for banks and NBFCs, respectively, with improved provisioning also driving net nonperforming assets to 1 percent among banks. The RBI’s stress tests suggest the financial system would be resilient to adverse macro shocks, but that a weaker tail of NBFCs remain vulnerable to liquidity risks, suggesting careful monitoring of lingering vulnerabilities in NBFCs is warranted.

Existing job opportunities would need to be significantly expanded to absorb India’s young and growing workforce and address India’s still pressing human development needs. While there are ongoing efforts to improve education and skilling and to create skills jobs, large gaps remain. Indeed, many Indian workers who cannot access high-quality service sector jobs—particularly those with limited education or skills— rely on own-account or unpaid work, primarily in agriculture, construction, and trade. These sectors, which account for over half of the workforce, demonstrate low productivity and value added, and limited catchup to the global productivity frontier. Staff estimate that India will need to create between 145 and 330 million jobs by 2050 to meet its growing population’s demand for work (Annex X).31\n",

Furthermore, 59 percent of employed females are classified as either participating in unpaid activities or self-employed. Supply and demand factors could explain Indian females’ low LFPR and high rate of informal work. Supply-side factors include time constraints due to domestic work, lack of relevant skills due to inadequate quality of education, safety concerns, and social norms. From the demand side, limited opportunities (particularly in rural areas), a rise in agriculture mechanization, and gender-biased occupation segregation are among the reasons limiting demand for female workers.\n",

Major streamlining of labor regulations was performed by the central government in 2020, but implementation is still lagging. Furthermore, in many sectors productivity is low and skill sets do not match firms’ needs, and thus active labor market policies (ALMP) can increase workers’ suitability for hiring and productivity. The authorities’ ongoing revamping of the skilling framework and the employee-employer matching tools embedded in the National Career Services Portal hold promise in this regard. The impact of labor market reforms and ALMP, however, depends on the overall business cycle conditions and on complementary reforms to mitigate any adverse effects. For instance, ALMP have large effects during periods of slack, so long as they are explicitly targeting well identified labor market failures. During times of strong growth, as India is currently experiencing, reducing employment protection could have positive effects if it is preceded by the establishment of strong social safety nets and product market reforms, and combined with programs that help workers move across jobs.33\n",

Other sectors, in particular services (business, health, information) have been more dynamic, but remain at less than 20 percent of the global frontier. There is thus room for India to grow by both accelerating the catch-up to the technology frontier across industries, via investment in productivity-enhancing technology and skills training, and by facilitating the flow of workers out of low-value-added jobs (e.g., agriculture and construction) to higher value-added jobs in manufacturing and services, which land and product market reforms in agriculture could help prompt.

Ongoing learning recovery programs should assist in this effort. More generally, policies should ensure that students are receiving quality education that positions them to enter the labor force and find gainful employment, including stemming school dropouts, tracking and measuring learning, and preparing teachers to teach according to students’ capabilities.

Trade restrictions on wheat and rice were introduced by the authorities to ensure food security and contain food price inflation; in this vein, agricultural reforms would provide a more durable solution by raising food productivity and mitigating food price volatility. The authorities introduced an Import Management System for IT equipment such as laptops, tablets, and personal computers to encourage imports from sources viewed as trustworthy and the development of local production of such goods, and to address IT security concerns.

            "Overall Assessment: The external position in fiscal year 2022/23 (ending in March 2023) was moderately stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies, suggesting that the CA deficit was somewhat smaller than implied by India’s level of per capita income, favorable growth prospects, demographic trends, and development needs. External vulnerabilities stem from weakening demand in some partner countries and volatile global financial conditions and commodity prices. In part reflecting buoyant services exports and declining oil prices, the CA deficit is projected to narrow in fiscal year 2023/24 before converging to its estimated norm over the medium term. The authorities have made some progress in external trade promotion and the liberalization of FDI and portfolio flows, but India’s trade and capital account regimes remain relatively restricted.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential Policy Responses: In the near term, government’s additional infrastructure spending will contribute to raising the CA deficit, thereby reducing the positive CA gap. To facilitate external rebalancing over the medium term, fiscal consolidation, development of export infrastructure, and negotiation of free trade agreements with main trading partners to provide a sustainable boost to exports of goods and services should be accompanied by further investment regime liberalization and a reduction in tariffs, especially on intermediate goods. Structural reforms could deepen integration into global value chains and attract FDI, hence mitigating external vulnerabilities. Exchange rate flexibility should act as the main shock absorber, with intervention limited to addressing disorderly market conditions.\n",

As of the end of 2022, India’s NIIP had improved marginally to –11.1 percent of GDP from –11.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2021, reflecting both valuation changes and a base effect of fast nominal GDP growth offsetting the CA deficit. Gross foreign assets were 25.9 percent of GDP (declining from 29.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2021), while gross foreign liabilities shrank to 37.0 percent of GDP from 40.6 percent of GDP at the end of previous year. The bulk of assets were in the form of official reserves and FDI, whereas liabilities included mostly debt and FDI.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assessment. With the CA deficit projected to narrow in 2023 and stabilize at a slightly higher level thereafter, the NIIP-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain broadly unchanged over the medium term, as robust nominal GDP expansion will offset the nominal NIIP decline resulting from projected CA deficits and valuation changes. India’s external debt liabilities are low compared with those of its peers, and short-term rollover risks are limited. The moderate level of foreign liabilities reflects India’s incremental approach to capital account liberalization, which has focused primarily on attracting FDI.\n",

As the pandemic restrictions were lifted, imports rebounded faster than exports on the back of pent-up domestic demand, rising private investments, and a surge in prices of oil and some other commodities after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The CA deficit is projected to narrow to about 1.8 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2023/24 largely reflecting the expected decline in oil import costs.

The EBA CA regression estimates a norm of –2.3 percent of GDP, with a standard error of 0.7 percent, thus implying a CA gap of 1.5 percent of GDP. In the IMF staff’s judgment, a CA deficit of up to 2½ percent of GDP is financeable in the medium term by a combination of steady FDI inflows, more volatile portfolio flows susceptible to changes in global risk appetite, and public and private external borrowings. Additional cyclical considerations factoring in the transitory impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and transport services are assessed to be near 0.1 Thus, the IMF staff assesses the CA gap to be 1.5 percent of GDP, with a range of 0.8 to 2.1 percent of GDP.

During the year, the Indian authorities made further steps toward capital account liberalization by further increasing limits on external borrowing and widening the scope of government bonds available for foreign investors, which could help moderate the interest costs associated with financing the CA deficit.\n",

In the first half of 2022, official FX reserves decreased from historically high levels in 2021, reflecting a widening CA deficit, portfolio investment outflows, and valuation changes. The reserves increased in subsequent months as the CA deficit narrowed and investor confidence improved. During this time, the Reserve Bank of India’s FX interventions aimed to smooth excessive market volatility and contributed to the rupee’s exchange rate stability. During December 2022-October 2023, the observed stability of the exchange rate prompted reclassification of India’s de facto exchange rate regime from “floating” to “stabilized arrangement” for that period, while the de jure classification remained “floating.” Reserves stood at $562.7 billion at the end of 2022.\n",

The fiscal aggregates specified in the framework, such as the level of revenue, expenditure and financing informs the annual budget process2. In India the framework for the Union is guided by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act 2018, which specifies a target debt to GDP ratio for the central and state governments of 40 and 20 percent, respectively, to be achieved by 2024/25, along with a ceiling on the fiscal deficit for the central government of 3 percent. The initial FRBM Act 2003 did not specify a debt target, rather it directed the Union government to present to parliament a 3-year rolling plan for the elimination of the revenue deficit and reduction of the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP. States mirrored this FRBM Act and hence many states do not have debt as an anchor, and when there is a debt anchor, it may not be aligned with the general government debt target adopted by the center (Patel and Singh, 2022)\n",

Specifically, the 3 percent deficit ceiling was removed, and the medium-term expenditure framework (including medium-term fiscal projections) was not presented to parliament.3 While the framework does allow for an expansion of the deficit under certain conditions by, at most, an additional 0.5 percent of GDP, this was insufficient for the pandemic response4.

Though this trend has been reversed: since FY2021/22 revenue projections have been based on conservative macroeconomic projections and the central government’s deficit targets have been met. In contrast state deficits have generally been below 3 percent of GDP since FY2005/06, since borrowing of states is regulated by the center7. The use of off-budget spending by the center and states also renders adherence to the headline deficit target less meaningful. That said, the introduction of the FRBM Act did coincide with a period of sustained improvement in the fiscal deficit.

A Fiscal Strategy Statement (which would replace the current Macroeconomic Framework Statement and Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement) outlining the government’s fiscal objectives, including the adjustment path, costing of new policy measures and reforms, and associated funding envelope, should be discussed by Cabinet early in the budget cycle (e.g., August), tabled in Parliament and published. This pre-budget statement would be the vehicle through which the main elements of the MTFF are publicly communicated. It would launch the ‘top-down’ budgeting process, by setting the overall spending ceiling that is communicated to line ministries, who, in turn, would be required to submit three-year budget estimates (Fouad and others, 2018). Indeed, many emerging market G-20 countries, such as Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa, are required by law to produce a pre-budget statement.\n",

Progress is being made on increasing coverage to local governments: the RBI recently published data on municipal state finances covering 70 percent of urban local bodies; there is also good progress being made on publishing quarterly central government data under GFS standards. Closer coordination is needed across the various levels of government to close data gaps and shorten reporting lags.

They are also exposed to substantial risks, including contingent liabilities from electricity distribution companies (Mukherjee and others, 2022). The recommendations discussed above should also apply to state level fiscal responsibility laws. At a minimum, states should align their fiscal anchors to be consistent with the post-pandemic FRBM Act. An option is to differentiate fiscal anchors across states depending on their current fiscal position and debt sustainability risks, The finance commission could provide recommendations for the appropriate anchor and medium-term adjustment path. This is similar to the newly proposed fiscal rules for EU member states (see Box).

The new framework should also discuss how to address repeated deviations or non-compliance. In many countries, independent fiscal councils fulfil this role through an assessment of fiscal plans and performance, evaluation of macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts, monitoring adherence to fiscal rules and costing of policy measures. The number of fiscal councils have increased over time, and in 2021, there were 49 countries with fiscal councils (Davoodi and others, 2022). Credibility can also be supported through institutional and procedural reforms that introduce greater transparency surrounding the fiscal adjustment path. This would enable real-time, ex-ante assessment of the fiscal strategy by the wider public (e.g., markets, press, civil society). This can be achieved by reporting on the assumptions underlying the adjustment path and explicitly costing the policy measures that are driving the adjustment. As noted earlier, an assessment of the risks surrounding the fiscal plan and associated contingency plans should also be presented because this also helps build credibility around the baseline projections. In many cases, medium-term fiscal plans are based on optimistic assumptions for revenue growth, which makes achieving the fiscal objectives more difficult. To INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61\n",

Public debt levels in India and many countries are now well above what was considered ‘safe’, casting doubt on the relevance of such targets (Caselli and others 2022). Although fiscal rules have come under such criticism, there is evidence that placing numerical targets on broad budget aggregates can help contain deficits. Fiscal principles or standards which move away from numerical guides towards broader guidelines for fiscal responsibility work well in countries with high levels of fiscal transparency and where there is active discourse, including amongst the voting public, on fiscal sustainability (IMF, 2021). For India, general government debt above 66 percent of GDP is estimated to have a detrimental effect on growth, but with current debt levels at around 81 percent of GDP, returning to these debt levels in the near future is not realistic (Pattanaik and others, 2023). What is needed as part of the revamped MTFF is a medium-term numerical anchor and fiscal strategy that are consistent with India’s development goals, while rebuilding fiscal buffers at an appropriate pace. Numerical fiscal rules signal the government’s intentions clearly and increase accountability, while the broader framework can incorporate flexibility in response to shocks (see discussion on escape clauses below).\n",

One such framework is the IMF’s Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Framework (SRDSF), presented in Annex IV, which assesses risks in the short, medium, and long term. The fiscal risks analysis discussed earlier should also inform the medium-term plan and can be used to calibrate alternative stress scenarios in the debt sustainability analysis. The SRDSF considers stress tests based on the realization of contingent liabilities, macro-fiscal shocks, maturity shortening and debt holder shocks. Fiscal plans should take into consideration long-term risks and challenges, such as climate change, facing the economy. The investment needed to reach net zero by 2070 for India has been estimated at between 4 and 8 percent of GDP per year (Ghosh and others, 2023). If India were to finance this investment with the current mix of funding sources, this would push debt to over 130 percent of GDP and increase annual financing needs to around 27 percent of GDP per year (see Annex IV Figure 6).

For India, favourable debt dynamics imply that debt would stabilize even when running persistent primary deficits. Based on currently announced policies, the primary deficit gradually narrows to around 2 percent of GDP by FY2028/2910. Maintaining this deficit and assuming nominal economic growth of 10.5 percent and interest rate at 6.25 percent implies that debt would eventually stabilize at around 57 percent of GDP (see SRDSA Annex IV for macroeconomic assumptions). However, starting from current debt levels, this would take decades to reach; in ten years debt is still above 76 percent of GDP. Given the shocks that India has been subject to, this path does not rebuild buffers at a sufficient pace and debt could potentially 8 One way to address this is to make the expenditure path conditional on revenue performance (see Brazil example in Box below).\n",

Following staff’s proposed reform scenario and targeting a primary deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP by FY2027/28 would rebuild buffers at a faster pace, with debt reaching 74 percent of GDP in FY2028/29 and 65 percent of GDP by FY2032/33.

India’s escape clause limited the deviation to 0.5 percent of GDP and was insufficient to respond to a shock as large as the pandemic. Going forward, the size of the allowed deviation should be reviewed. Importantly for India, the activation of escape clauses should be accompanied by a medium-term plan to either return to the anchor or a review of the anchor in line with the new economic environment. Since escape clauses are triggered during a period of heightened economic uncertainty, clarity on the medium-term fiscal plan is even more important to anchor expectations and demonstrate commitment to sustainability.

The proposals seek to move to a more risk-based surveillance framework that puts public debt sustainability at its core, while promoting sustainable and inclusive growth, and aims at strengthening national ownership by requiring each member state to present a medium-term fiscal plan, covering investment, structural reforms and fiscal policy for the upcoming four years. While high-debt countries are required to present a plan that convincingly demonstrates a downward trajectory for public debt to GDP, countries themselves set the policies underpinning compliance with targets, operationalized through multi-year expenditure targets. Member States will present annual progress reports to facilitate more effective monitoring and enforcement of the implementation of these commitments. A minimum adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP per year will have to be implemented so long as the overall deficit remains above 3 percent of GDP. The debt and deficit benchmarks of 60 percent of GDP and 3 percent of GDP, respectively, would remain. Member states with debt and deficit above these benchmarks would be issued a country-specific, ‘technical trajectory’ by the EC to guide expenditure targets. The adjustment period in the Commission’s proposal is four years—at the end of which debt needs to be put on a downward trajectory. Countries implementing ambitious structural reforms or public investments can extend this adjustment period by up to seven years. The activation of escape clauses would be determined by the European Council, based on the recommendation of the EC. The proposals, which emphasizes a risk-based framework and focuses on medium term fiscal strategies, are broadly in line with IMF Staff recommendations. IMF Staff also recommend that (i) a stronger role for national fiscal institutions, including to assess fiscal plans; and (ii) introduction of an EU fiscal capacity (Arnold and others, 2022).\n",

This fiscal consolidation was supported by PFM reforms, such as the development of a fiscal framework that was diligently adhered to. As a result, Odisha reduced debt to 15 percent of GSDP in FY2012/13 following a peak at 51 percent in FY2002/03.

These led to Rupee depreciation against the US dollar and a decline in FX reserves, partly reflecting foreign exchange intervention (FXI) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Interest rate hikes abroad lead to almost 4 percent Rupee depreciation in real effective terms. The depreciation, together with adverse spillovers on domestic price- and wage- pressures in India push up India’s core inflation by almost 2 percentage points at its peak.

Under Scenario 2, global financial market turmoil, as a result of aggressive interest rate hikes in the US and other key central banks, leads to a risk-off episode with capital outflows and higher domestic risk premiums. Such large shocks, if happening when the FX market is notably shallower, can cause significant exchange rate depreciation. Model simulation suggests that the combination of capital outflow and risk premium shocks leads to a sharp depreciation of the real rupee exchange rate (15 percent at its peak). Despite gaining competitiveness, India’s exports would decline as foreign demand declines although net exports would, on average, remain positive as imports also fall. Nonetheless, the downturn in domestic demand would outweigh the improvement in net trade with India’s output gap negatively impacted and worsening over time. India’s core inflation would increase slightly driven by the depreciation.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. When destabilizing capital outflows arise in shallow FX markets, FXI can ease inflation-output tradeoff for policymakers. The scenario assumes that large capital outflow shocks occur when India’s FX market turns shallower. In such a scenario, the use of FXI could provide better output-inflation outcomes. In particular, an FX intervention of about 2.5 percent of GDP will help moderate inflationary pressures by reducing the UIP risk premia and limiting the extent to which the rupee depreciates (from 15 percent to 5 percent at peak). Core inflation will rise, but by less compared to its rise under only IR policy and will converge to 4 percent headline inflation target towards the end of the projection period. Furthermore, the use of FXI takes some pressure off the policy rate hike, which reduces the drag on domestic activity. Specifically, the output gap under the IR+FXI policy option, despite being negative from adverse shocks, will gradually improve over the medium term when both interest rate and FXI are used, while the output gap under the IR only policy option deteriorates further over time. When both policy tools are used, the smaller policy rate hike also implies a smaller increase in the long-term rate and may be less disruptive to domestic fixed income and funding markets.\n",

However, as illustrated by the first scenario, FXI is notably less effective when the FX market is deeper, and our model estimations indicate that India’s FX market is often deep and liquid. Accordingly, the effectiveness of FXI in easing inflation-output trade-offs is likely to be limited in normal times when the FX markets are liquid.\n",

RPs can be tailored to address the specific nuances of financial stress associated with a borrower and the respective commercial considerations of the lenders, subject to certain boundary conditions and prudential requirements so as to ensure that only viable resolution plans are implemented.

According to the International Finance Corporation, only about 15 percent of businesses in the MSME sector were registered in 2018, and while the launch of the Udyam online MSME registration portal increased the number of registered MSME substantially, the lack of complete official data on MSMEs suggests the contribution of MSMEs to the Indian economy may be significantly underestimated.4,5 For instance, the National Accounts Statistics for 2021-22 2 In 2020, the authorities revamped and harmonized the definition of an MSME to use thresholds for turnover and investment as the measurement, rather than just investment (which previously excluded some services firms).\n",

Accurate data is lacking but past estimates suggest a large majority of MSMEs have never received formal credit, and rely on informal sources where available, implying a large credit gap of unmet demand and higher costs7. Moreover, a plurality of Indian firms8 reported that access to finance is the biggest obstacle they face for doing business, with the issue somewhat more pressing for small and medium sized firms. Among MSMEs, around one-third are believed to be at least partly or fully financially constrained.9 lack of access to financing or higher costs of capital could also disincentivize firms from joining the formal economy. Access to finance and potential policy support can also be seen in the context of broader challenges facing MSMEs. For example, integration into local and global supply chains may be tied into the ability to borrow. Some studies suggest enterprises that have joined e-commerce networks have had greater access to financing, while fintech platforms may also be able to directly leverage sales data for credit purposes.10\n",

Accordingly, the average loan size of private banks tends to be larger than that of PSBs and NBFCs. Delinquency rates tend to be lowest for private banks, and the highest for NBFCs, though this may partially reflect composition effects, as private banks devote a higher share to low risk originations17. Notably, the share of borrowers classified as high risk is demonstrably higher among medium-sized enterprises, which could reflect factors that stand outside of the credit risk model, including structural bias, greater access to lenders for larger borrowers, or more effective collateral for example. In FY23Q1, loan approval rates—which may also reflect bank effectiveness at converting inquiries into loans— among lower risk inquiries were highest for private banks (39 percent), and lowest at public banks (22 percent), fairly similar for medium risk, and slightly higher for private banks at high risk (where approval rates were considerably lower across all lenders).\n",

Moreover, lending to MSMEs may not always be appealing for risk averse loan officers, given the smaller ticket sizes, higher default rates, and potentially challenging collections, despite margins tending to be attractive. Weaker bank penetration in some lower income states and rural areas may also play a limiting factor. On the demand side, prospective borrowers may lack proper documentation to secure loans or believe they are ineligible, while the process of disbursing funds may take too long. Surveys suggest MSME borrowers have been reluctant to apply for formal credit ratings, and traditional credit risk models tend to be a poor fit for firms that lack accurate financial information, have limited capital, and may not be interested in scaling up.

The rapidly expanding nonbank financial, fintech, and digital lending landscape has significant potential, though the ecosystem is still developing and may take time to become a driver of growth at the macro level. Fintechs and NBFCs can help intermediate credit to MSMEs as both partners and competitors to the traditional banking system. Various models exist where fintechs may receive funding directly from banks to lend onwards, or indirectly as a lending agent, often conducting customer outreach, credit analysis, and collections themselves. Lending partnerships through so called “co creation” models, can allow NBFCs or fintechs to leverage the balance sheets of larger institutions, combined with their own platforms and data advantages. Recent regulatory developments have helped clarify the nature of some such arrangements19 to improve transparency, though supervisory follow up will be needed as the interaction between different players (fintechs, NBFCs, banks) is constantly evolving. More broadly, new initiatives such as the Account Aggregator (for MSMEs), Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit, National Financial Information Registry, could also facilitate a smoother credit process for lenders if implemented effectively. Ensuring adequate consumer protection, developing data transparency, and monitoring financial stability risks should continue to be prioritized going forward.\n",

            "India has been one of the fastest growing countries globally in recent years. Yet this growth has been uneven, with many sectors far from the technological frontier and many workers still employed in low-productivity jobs, together contributing little to overall value added. For India to harness its full potential, it is critical to understand what has driven growth in the past, where growth can come from in the future, and how workers can both contribute to and benefit from a growing Indian economy.\n",

            "1. India has witnessed strong growth in recent years, yet many Indian workers remain in low paying, lower productivity jobs. Real GDP growth has averaged over 6 percent since 2000, on the back of a large and expanding services sector. This growth has lifted an estimated 415 million people out of multidimensional poverty since 2005 (Arbatli-Saxegaard and others, 2022). At the same time, manufacturing sector growth has remained sluggish and over half of all workers remain in low-productive jobs in agriculture, construction, and trade. India needs to create productive, well-paying jobs in labor-intensive sectors for its growing population to achieve higher, more inclusive, and sustainable growth going forward.

India’s working age population (defined as 15 years and older) stood at just over 1 billion in 2022.2 Of this group, 50 percent were working (the labor force participation rate was 53 percent and the unemployment rate 5.7 percent according to PLFS data). Assuming India is at full employment at the current unemployment rate, the country was missing an estimated 3-87 million jobs in 2022.3 Based on population projections, India will need to create 145- 330 million jobs by 2050 to maintain its current labor force participation rate (and its current unemployment rate).4 1 Prepared by Cristian Alonso and Margaux MacDonald.\n",

While the 2005 level is from the Employment Unemployment Survey, and not the PLFS, and thus not strictly comparable, a 60 percent LFPR is also the average LFPR of other G20 emerging market economies and thus a reasonable comparator. We count MNREGA workers as missing jobs because these jobs are for otherwise willing workers who cannot find work elsewhere.\n",

The latter includes, for example, those working part time but desiring fully time work, those over-skilled for their jobs (see the policy option section of this annex), and those working as unpaid family labor (especially women, see Annex X). It would also be important to take into consideration the number of non-farm jobs needed to be created. As the Indian economy continues to shift from farm to non-farm work, employment in the categories of unpaid family worker, own-account workers, and casual workers will decline, and more regular wage jobs in urban areas will be needed to absorb this extra labor.

Construction has also become an important employer, with about 12 percent of workers in 2019.

In comparison, labor in 2019-20 in manufacturing and services was over 4.5 times more productive than in agriculture. With low productivity workers in agriculture and construction making up over half the Indian workforce, there is significant potential to boost growth by enacting productivity-enhancing reforms to the sectors which will free workers to move to other, more productive sectors.

Value added growth in India has shifted away from being labor-driven in the 1970s-80s towards more physical capital and TFP-driven in recent decades. This has been linked to pro-business reforms in the 1980s, market reforms in the early 1990s, the liberalization of the economy and increases in FDI, and rapid growth in the services sectors (Kotera and Xu, 2023, and references therein). On a sectoral-basis capital and TFP have become more important in the services sector in particular, India’s main driver of value added. This suggests that while services are largely supporting the Indian economy—broadly on account of the structural reforms—job creation in that sector has not sufficient to deliver the number of formal, high productivity jobs needed to raise growth and fully employ the working age population. The limited contribution of employment to value added in agriculture stems from the overall decline in workers in that sector. For construction, growth has been largely driven by the shift of workers into the sector with little benefits from overall productivity. 10.00\n",

Unlike other emerging markets, however, growth in India is driven in large part by capital and TFP (Kotera and Xu, 2023), making it more comparable to advanced economies. For a more detailed comparison of development trajectory of India relative to its South Asian peers specifically, see Salgado and Anand (2023). By supporting the growth of large, productive sectors like manufacturing much of India’s labor could be absorbed – and thereby making labor a more important contributor to growth. Furthermore, high quality spending on improving education and training would help boost the contribution from labor quality, as has been observed in other emerging markets.\n",

We compare Indian labor productivity by industry to the technological frontier, which we define as the 90th percentile of labor productivity among advanced economies included in the KLEMS database. 5 Agriculture has remained stuck at low productivity levels since 1995. In 1995, the productivity of a worker in agriculture in India was only 2.3 percent of that observed for a country at the technological frontier. By 2019, it had increased to only 2.9 percent. Catch-up to the frontier was also weak for several manufacturing industries (wood and paper, chemicals, electrical and optical equipment, and other manufacturing). Manufacturing of machinery regressed over this period, moving backwards by 2 percentage points in terms of distance to the labor productivity frontier. Productivity in construction improved marginally, catch-up to the technological frontier was much faster in mining and petroleum refining, as well as information and business services, health, and other services. Overall, services have been more dynamic in catching-up to the technological frontier. Labor productivity in business services is at 18 percent of the frontier. 5 We define labor productivity as the value added (in constant U.S. dollars) per employee at the industry level. Results are robust to using value added measured in industry-specific PPP-adjusted U.S. dollars.\n",

            "11. Reallocation of workers towards more dynamic sectors could accelerate growth and raise wages for Indian workers. Employment in agriculture declined by 17 million between 1995 and 2019, which is encouraging. But with agriculture still accounting for 43 percent of the workers in the country, significantly more reallocation towards higher value-added jobs would be needed. Employment grew the most in construction (46 million) and trade (33 million), both relatively low-productivity industries that exhibited limited catch-up to the technological frontier over the last two and a half decades. Manufacturing added only 15 million jobs over this period, a tenth of the net job creation. Employment in business services did increase remarkably by 13 million workers from just 1.6 million in 1995 to 14 million in 2019, while the industry narrowed the distance to the technological frontier by 9 percentage points—a very positive outcome. Other industries with fast catch-up such as mining, petroleum refining, and information services, have added few jobs as expected given their relatively low labor-intensity. Thus, there is room for India to grow both by accelerating the catch-up to the technological frontier across industries and by reallocating workers from low value-added jobs, particularly in agriculture, to higher value-added jobs in manufacturing and services over the coming decades.\n",

            "12. Strong performance by Indian firms, measured by sales per employee, is associated with size. Sales per employee, an imperfect proxy of labor productivity, can be computed at the firm level for medium and large firms across the world included in the ORBIS database. In line with the results at the industry level, the median productivity of Indian firms is low, averaging 17 percent of the sales per employee by frontier firms across industries. But there are some sectors with firms exhibiting sales per employee closer or even above the frontier, such as manufacturing of jewelry and soap, printing of newspapers, and other professional services. Furthermore, there are 126 Indian firms already operating at the technological frontier in the sense that their sales per employee are above that of the 95th percentile for non-Indian firms. Twelve of those Indian firms at the frontier operate in computer programming or other information technology services, and another seven engage in jewelry manufacturing. These strong Indian performers tend to be large firms. Three quarters of the Indian firms operating at the frontier have assets greater than $100 million whereas only half of the Indian firms not at the frontier have such level of assets. They are also slightly more likely to be foreign-owned, with 10 percent of the Indian firms at the frontier being foreign-owned compared to 7 percent for non-frontier Indian firms.6 The success of these Indian firms stresses the importance of removing obstacles preventing firms to grow and fostering foreign direct investment. In addition, the presence of these strong performers across industries is consistent with India’s increasing diversification and complexity of exports (Nageswaran and Unnikrishnan, 2023; Harvard’s Growth Lab, 2023). 6 A firm is defined to be foreign owned if its global ultimate owner as identified by ORBIS is not Indian. This correlation is in line with previous literature that has found that FDI can increase productivity (Smarzynska Javorcik, 2004; Zhao and Zhang, 2010: Li and Tanna, 2019).\n",

Over 60 percent of craft and related workers and plant and machine operators and assemblers and 52 percent of services and sales workers have similarly had too few years of formal schooling. There are also some pockets of overeducation with workers having more years of formal education than what would be desirable for their occupation. This is the case for clerks and technicians, and appears particularly prevalent in Chandigarh, Puduchery, Andaman & N. Island, Haryana, and Delhi. The authorities are working on addressing these challenges, including through the 2020 National Education Policy aiming to revamp the education system towards meeting their aspirational goals for the 21st century (GoI, 2020). They are also working on a dynamic, industry-centric, and forward-looking skilling ecosystem, including through technologically-equipped Industrial Training Institutes with a combined annual enrollment of 1.24 million students, Technical and Vocational Education and Training integration in schools and higher education institutes, apprenticeship for 740 thousand trainees, industry-aligned short-term training, and catalyzing entrepreneurship.

However, implementation of these reforms, which are pending notification of the rules by the Centre and state governments, should progress more rapidly. Evidence shows that in India, these strict labor market regulations have contributed to a misallocation of labor (Mohommad and others, 2021). Furthermore, loosening restrictive employment protection legislation would lead to an increase in total employment over time (including female employment), though it may briefly cause a decline in employment during the initial reallocation of labor (Agarwal and others, 2022). As such, working with states to accelerate the reform momentum in this area would be essential to further enhance labor market flexibility while still providing adequate protection for workers.\n",

The authorities’ efforts to remove bureaucratic inefficiencies and improve the business climate are supported by their digitalization push. For example, the launch of the Udyam Portal aims to streamline registration for MSMEs. In addition, their Production-Linked Incentive schemes (PLIs) are being perceived by market participants as a signal of the government’s intention to work with the private sector to remove obstacles holding back investments and employment. PLIs provide subsidies to firms that meet investment and employment targets in specific sectors. The multiyear cost of the existing PLIs assuming full implementation is relatively low at 0.72 percent of FY 2022/23 GDP and the authorities estimate they may help create up to 6 million jobs (GoI, 2022). While it is too early to assess these schemes and the data is not available yet, targeted and temporary industrial policy could help address market failures. At the same time, however, it would be important to subject these schemes to rigorous cost-benefit analysis, to keep them time-bound, and to ensure competition is fostered. Importantly, PLIs do not replace broader market reforms, which should continue to be prioritized.\n",

As 63 percent of females are participating in unpaid activities (domestic duties or helping family business), encouraging females to shift into paid and higher productivity employment is crucial for enhancing gender inclusion and further boosting growth.

While improving recently, the female labor force participation rate (LFPR) in India remains low and below historical levels.2 In CY2022, the female LFPR in India was 28.6 percent, compared to 76.7 percent for males.3 While a cross-country comparison between income and gender gaps in the LFPR suggests a U-shaped relationship, India remains well below its economic peers in terms of female LFPR. Further, the LFPR for women with advanced education in India is well below most other countries, which is not the case for men with advanced education.4 In addition, a large heterogeneity in the female LFPR exists across states and union territories (UTs) in India, ranging from 10 to 65 percent in CY2022, while differences for males are relatively smaller. Hence, the gender gap (ratio of female to male LFPR) differs significantly across states and UTs, ranging from 80 to 14 percent. Gender gap in LFPR and GNI per capita\n",

Supply-side factors affecting female LFPR include time constraints due to domestic and caregiving work (IWWAGE, 2021), lack of relevant skills (Mehrotra & Parida, 2017), and social norms (Bernhardt et al., 2018). Lower mobility due to limited bus service and safety concerns could also discourage females from undertaking non-agriculture jobs (Siddique (2022) and Lei et al. (2019)). On the demand side, mechanization of agriculture coupled with limited availability of non-agricultural and regular part-time employment opportunities, especially in rural areas, likely dampen female LFPR (Afridi et al. (2020), Fletcher et al. (2017), and Chatterjee et al. (2015)). In addition, gender-biased occupational segregation and employment practices adversely affect female LFPR (Kapsos et al., 2014).

To enhance employability of women, the Government is providing education, skills and vocational training under the National Education Policy and Skill India Mission. To enhance women’s safety and convenience for commuting to jobs, funding has been provided to build working women hostels and in certain regions female-only public transportation or free public transportation is available.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Additional efforts are needed to address the barriers depressing female LFPR and to encourage women out of unpaid activities and into paid or higher productivity jobs. To ease time constraints due to unpaid domestic work, further widespread access to enabling services (such as child and elderly care services and facilities) and investment toward time-saving infrastructure is needed. Given the rapid progress of technologies and digitalization, strengthening female skilling through education and vocational training that matches needs of the labor market will enhance their employability. Policy actions also include raising awareness of the importance of female participation in the labor market, prohibiting any discriminatory employment practices, further addressing the safety concerns of females, developing road infrastructure, and enhancing public transportation. Promoting the development of non-agriculture sectors, especially in rural areas, by focusing on labor-intensive industries and creating service demand could improve female LFPR and productivity. Given the burden of household work for females, facilitating the creation of jobs with flexibility in working hours and location will make it easier for females to enter the labor force. In this respect, reducing any barriers to firms expanding in size could help increase suitable job opportunities for all, including females, as larger firms can offer greater flexibility as well as higher benefits. Narrowing gender gaps in LFPR should be a priority as it would bring positive spillovers such as boosting economic growth and male income (Ostry et al., 2018). The government’s “Women-led development” initiative under the G-20 presidency provides a strong foundation for these efforts, which policy reforms should build on.\n",

            "India has benefited from steady FDI inflows in recent years and has built a pipeline of new projects. This annex explores the factors that made certain Indian states an attractive destination for FDIs and can help sustain FDI inflows going forward.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. FDI inflows into India increased since early 2010s in nominal terms and in proportion to GDP. According to RBI’s BoP data, FDI inflows to India doubled from their post-GFC low of about US$27 billion in FY2012/13 to a peak of about US$56 billion in FY2021/22 (Figure 1). While FDI in many other countries suffered during the pandemic, in FY2020/21 India received record-large foreign investments in its computer services, which were uniquely positioned to meet demand for outsourcing IT and other business services from countries affected by the Covid lockdowns. In CY2020-22, cumulative FDIs received by India exceeded 5 percent of GDP, getting ahead of China (about 3 percent of GDP) but lagging some regional and global peers such as South Africa and Vietnam (about 13 percent of GDP each). In FY2022/23, FDI to India retreated from its peak level amid a negative shock from the war in Ukraine and associated deepening geoeconomic fragmentation. In early FY2023/24, high frequency data indicated that FDI began to recover gradually from the low level reached in the previous fiscal year, suggesting that the slowdown could be transitory and FDI could rebound to at least the average pre-pandemic level over the medium term.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. A large pipeline of new projects confirms that India remains an attractive FDI destination, despite temporary setbacks. With the record-high “pipeline” of announced greenfield FDI projects of about US$78 billion and other 1,000 announced deals in CY 2022, India came ahead of its global and regional peers. India became the third country in the world by the number of announced deals (after the U.S. and U.K.) and second by the project finance deals (after the U.S.). Of course, announced deals do not always culminate in actual investments, as evidenced by cancellation of the Foxconn (Taiwan Province of China) and Vedanta Resources (India) plans (US$19 billion) to build a chip factory in India.1 Incoming FDIs are highly concentrated by receiving states, industries, and countries of\n",

            "Almost a third of FDIs into India in FY 2020/21 - 22/23 came from Singapore. The U.S. became the second leading source of FDI accounting for almost 1/5 of the total and sidelining the traditional # 2 source country, Mauritius. As financial hubs, both Singapore and Mauritius intermediate regional and global financial flows, which blurs the ultimate source of FDI coming from these two countries.\n",

            "Among industries, Manufacturing and Computer Services were the top destinations of FDI in FY 2020/21 - 22/23, each accounting for almost a quarter of the total. Each of four other industries took close to 1/10 of the inflows: Financial Services, Retail & Wholesale Trade, Communication Services, and Transport.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. A better business climate and proximity to political and financial centers explains the relative success of some Indian states in attracting FDIs. The states that attract most FDIs take top positions in the 2022 edition of the Export Preparedness Index compiled by NITI Aayog and the Institute for Competitiveness (Figure 2). They also come at the top of individual components of the index, most notably its Business Ecosystem ranking (which covers business environment, infrastructure, and transport connectivity). Comparison of FDI performance with Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP) ranking for 2020—compiled by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry—reveals that not only the business climate, but the advantage of being the political capital (Delhi) or the “financial capital” (Mumbai) helps attract FDI. Plotting Indian states’ shares of attracted FDI on a logarithmic scale reveals striking correlation with various business climate indices (Figure 2, right-hand charts). This exponential relation between business climate indices and FDI indicates that improving business climate delivers highest gains to the leaders.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Further improving business climate and removing barriers to FDIs can help sustain steady FDI inflows over the medium term. After significant liberalization over the last two decades, many barriers and restrictions limiting FDI inflows to India remain in place. Investments in certain sectors of economy are capped or require government approval. For example, FDIs in print media and streaming of news are limited to 26 percent of total equity, and even these investments require government clearance. FDIs in air transport services, private sector banking, pension sector, news broadcasting, and electric power exchanges are capped at 49 percent of total equity. In the early 2022, the government has amended FDI rules by a special decision to allow FDI for up to 20 percent of equity in the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) to allow foreign investors’ participation in its IPO. Revisiting the remaining caps and restrictions can facilitate large FDI inflows to India, in particular to its aerospace industry that can capitalize on rising foreign interest after the successful landing of the India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the unexplored southern pole of the moon in August 2023. Moreover, improving the\n",

            "business climate across the entire country, particularly in demographically rich states, to the level of the top states can greatly increase India’s potential for attracting FDI. At the same time, imposing new or tightening existing export and import restrictions can discourage FDI inflows, in part because rising costs of imported intermediate inputs can undermine export competitiveness of products produced in India.\n",

RBI’s stated intervention objective is to curb excessive volatility. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating, while de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized arrangement for the period December 2022-October 2023. The reclassification is based on a statistical methodology that is implemented by staff evenhandedly across member countries. The methodology follows a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities.\n",

            "On August 20, 1994, India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): restrictions related to the non-transferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement; restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans by nonresident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.\n",

Effective October 2023, the tax rates on personal payments and travel services were raised to discourage underreporting of income by high-net-worth individuals on their tax return. While the income tax law provides for the reimbursement of these taxes, they still give rise to exchange restrictions as they represent an additional burden/cost on making current international payments and transfers. The exchange restrictions arise from: (i) 20 percent tax on personal remittances above the annual Rs 700,000 threshold; (ii) 0.5 percent tax on remittances above the annual Rs 700,000 threshold for education payments where financed by loan; (iii) 5 percent tax on payments above the annual Rs 700,000 threshold for education and medical services, and (iv) 5 percent tax on payments for travel services (overseas packages) below the annual threshold of Rs 700,000 and 20 percent tax thereafter, to the extent that it applies to cross-border payments (i.e to nonresident seller).\n",

            "National Accounts and employment statistics: In January 2015 the Central Statistical Office (CSO) released a new series of national accounts, with base year 2011/12. In addition to the shift in the base year for measuring growth, the revisions reflected a review of source data and compilation methods, and implementation of the 2008 System of National Accounts. The current base year of 2011/12 is outdated, and GDP should be rebased as soon as feasible. For current price estimates, the data sources provide adequate coverage of economic activities, and the methodology is broadly consistent with international standards and best practices. Nonetheless, an indirect-tax-based extrapolation of trade turnover value from the base year does not provide an accurate gauge of growth of economy-wide value added from trade. The supply-side data are deemed to be of better quality than expenditure-side data. There are still some weaknesses in the deflation method used to derive value added. Also, the compilation of constant price GDP deviate from the conceptual requirements of the national accounts, in part due to the use of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) as a deflator for many economic activities. The appropriate price to deflate GDP by type of activity is the Producer Price Index (PPI), which is under development. Large revisions to historical series, the relatively short time span of the revised series, major discrepancies between GDP by activity and GDP by expenditure, and the lack of official seasonally-adjusted quarterly GDP series complicate analysis. Together, these weaknesses make it challenging to monitor high frequency trends in India’s economy through official statistics, particularly from the demand side.\n",

In early 2015, the CPI weights were updated again using 2011/12 expenditure data and the CPI series was revised from January 2015. The CPIs are published with a lag of about two weeks. Presently, there also remain four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers).

Employment has surpassed the pre pandemic level and, while the informal sector continues to dominate, formalization has progressed. The financial sector has been resilient—strongest in several years—and largely unaffected by global financial stress in early 2023. The current account deficit in FY2022/23 widened as the post-pandemic recovery of domestic demand and transitory external shocks outweighed the impact of robust services exports and proactive diversification of critical oil imports. While the budget deficit has eased, public debt remains elevated and fiscal buffers need to be rebuilt.

The current account deficit is expected to improve to 1.8 percent of GDP in FY2023/24 as a result of resilient services exports and, to a lesser extent, lower oil import costs. Going forward, the country’s foundational digital public infrastructure and a strong government infrastructure program will continue to sustain growth.

Directors agreed that exchange rate flexibility should remain the first line of defense in absorbing external shocks, with foreign exchange interventions limited to addressing disorderly market conditions. Regarding staff’s recent reclassification of India’s de facto exchange rate regime for the period December 2022 to October 2023, many Directors noted the divergence of authorities’ views with that of staff and encouraged continued staff engagement on this issue, with a few Directors encouraging staff and the authorities to resolve these differences.
